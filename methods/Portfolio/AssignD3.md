# Assignment:

  - You need **not** create supplemental materials like sample code, assignments, etc.
  - This is, at least partly, an exercise in collaborative planning. There are a number of different teaching styles amongst you all, and experience with various tools. Focus on having productive conversations and be open to tools & methods that you may not use.
