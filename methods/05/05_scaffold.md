### Technique 1: TASK SEQUENCING/ SLICING / SPIRALING
![]( https://c.tenor.com/uAKW6ESyWgMAAAAS/spiral.gif )

#### Well-suited to...
* related concepts build on each other

#### Example
* BinarySearch before BinarySearchRecursive
* findSmallestIndex before selection sorting method

### Technique 2: PSEUDOCODE
plain language description of the steps in an algorithm.

#### Variations:
* Pseudocode written as comments into provided code
* Flowchart diagram
* Written words on a slide

#### Well-suited to...
* problem-solving
* multi-step functions
* beginning of the year or new topic/concept

#### Example
* Provide the following for a linear searching method:

  * ```//traverse the array```
  * ```//check if the current index is holding the target value```
  * ```// return the index```
  * ```//if not found, return -1```

#### Well-suited to...
* pair programming
* tasks with varying degrees of complexity
* carousel-tasks

#### Example
* Driver should not be the most experienced team member
* Develop specific roles for all team members

* * * *

Extra Tasks:
* DIFFERENTIATED TASKS: Splitting tasks into beginner, intermediate, advanced
* STARTER CODE: provide stubs, method header, parameters
* HELPER CODE: Convenience methods provided
* REFERENCE CODE: Provide working code to compare to
