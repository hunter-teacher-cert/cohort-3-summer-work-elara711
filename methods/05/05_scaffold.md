### Technique 1: TASK SEQUENCING/ SLICING / SPIRALING
![spiral](https://d384mi819045d8.cloudfront.net/i/_/regular/82157.jpg~q=85)

#### Well-suited to...
* related concepts build on each other

#### Example
* BinarySearch before BinarySearchRecursive
* findSmallestIndex before selection sorting method

  
* * *
### Technique 2: PSEUDOCODE
plain language description of the steps in an algorithm.
![]()

#### Variations:
* Pseudocode written as comments into provided code
* Flowchart diagram
* Written words on a slide

#### Well-suited to...
* problem-solving
* multi-step functions
* beginning of the year or new topic/concept

#### Example
* Provide the following for a linear searching method:

  * ```//traverse the array```
  * ```//check if the current index is holding the target value```
  * ```// return the index```
  * ```//if not found, return -1```

### Technique 3: MIXED-LEVEL GROUPING
Grouping advanced students with beginner students (Group should contain different skill levels)
![](  )

#### Well-suited to...
* pair programming
* tasks with varying degrees of complexity
* carousel-tasks

#### Example
* Driver should not be the most experienced team member
* Develop specific roles for all team members

* * * *

Extra Tasks:
* DIFFERENTIATED TASKS: Splitting tasks into beginner, intermediate, advanced
* STARTER CODE: provide stubs, method header, parameters
* HELPER CODE: Convenience methods provided
* REFERENCE CODE: Provide working code to compare to
